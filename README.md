# GCodeFixer

This small program can be used to fix GCode that is generated by Eagle (for a PCB) so it is compatible with a ShapeOko 3 (and its version of GRABL).

You can use the fixer.jar as showed in fixer.bat.

For more details, look at this post:  http://francois-ouellet.ca/milling-a-pcb-designed-in-eagle-with-a-shapeoko-3/.
